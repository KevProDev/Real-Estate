Real Estate 

Challenge: 
Take a wireframe from conception to implementation and design while improving user interface along the way. Understanding browser and device compatibility.

Needs to allow its users to find the perfect house. Should be fast and easy to use. Users should be able to filter threw criteria to find the perfect house.

Outcome:
Incorporate react that allows only the listings section to refresh and not the page. Save reload time and user retention. This also reduces html request. 

Organize JavaScript base on components of the page for better debugging if occurs. Push code to git to manage version control.
